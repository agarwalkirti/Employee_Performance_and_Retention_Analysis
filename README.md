# Employee_Performance_and_Retention_Analysis

Employee Performance and Retention Analysis:

Objective:
This project aims to develop an Employee Performance and Retention Analysis using a real-world dataset. The goal is to apply concepts from probability, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning to analyze employee data and predict performance and retention trends. 

Libraries used:
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / Keras

Project Phases: data collection, analysis, prediction, and reporting.

Phase 1 - Data Collection and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Step 1 - Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dataset - Used a sample employee dataset. The dataset contains features such as: Employee ID, Name, Age, Department, Salary, Years at Company, Performance Score, Attrition (Yes/No)

Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective - Performed an initial analysis to understand the dataset and its key trends.
Calculated descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for numerical columns.
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize: Pairplot to explore relationships between multiple features.
Heatmap for correlation analysis. Identified outliers in numerical features (using boxplots).

Step 3 - Probability and Statistical Analysis
Objective - Applied probability concepts and statistical tests to better understand the dataset.
Probability - Calculated the probability of an employee leaving based on factors like performance scores and department.
Bayes' Theorem - Used Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of employee attrition given performance score.
Hypothesis Testing - Tested whether the mean performance score differs across departments.

Phase 2 - Predictive Modeling
Step 4 - Feature Engineering and Encoding
Objective - Prepared the data for machine learning models.
Tasks - Scaled numerical features such as Salary and Performance Scores using Min-Max Scaling or Standardization.
Applied Label Encoding to categorical features (e.g., Attrition, Department).

Step 5 - Employee Attrition Prediction Model
Objective - Built a machine learning model to predict employee attrition (i.e., whether an employee will leave or stay).
Splited the dataset into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn.
Logistic Regression- classification model is used(Random Forest Classifier can be used).
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualized the confusion matrix to check the model’s performance.

Step 6 - Employee Performance Prediction Model
Objective - Built a regression model to predict employee performance based on various features.
Splited the dataset into training and testing sets.
Built a Linear Regression model to predict Performance Score.
Evaluated the model using R-squared (R²) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualized predicted vs. actual performance scores.

Phase 3 - Deep Learning Models
Step 7 - Deep Learning for Employee Performance Prediction
Applied deep learning techniques to predict employee performance using neural networks.
Prepared the dataset for use with TensorFlow or Keras.
Built a feedforward neural network:
Input layer - Employee features like Age, Salary, Department.
Hidden layers - Dense layers with activation functions (e.g., ReLU).
Output layer - Predicted Performance Score.
Trained the model using Mean Squared Error as the loss function.
Evaluated the model's performance on the test set.

Step 8 - Employee Attrition Analysis with Deep Learning
Objective - Used deep learning for classification to predict employee attrition based on various features.
Built a neural network model with input features like Age, Department, Performance Score, etc.
Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Phase 4 - Reporting and Insights
Step 9 - Insights and Recommendations
Objective - Derived actionable insights based on your analysis and predictions.
Summarized key findings, such as:
Key factors contributing to employee performance.
High-risk departments or employee groups for attrition.
Recommended strategies to improve retention, such as:
Department-wise performance improvement plans.
Targeted employee engagement programs.

Step 10 - Data Visualization and Reporting
Objective - Presented the findings in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.
Generated interactive data visualizations such as:
Line Plots to show performance trends.
Bar Charts for department-wise attrition.
Scatter Plots for salary vs. performance.
Prepared a detailed project report summarizing:
The analysis and insights derived.
Model evaluation and predictive capabilities.
Visualizations and recommendations.
